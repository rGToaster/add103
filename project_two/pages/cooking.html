            <p>This top 5 list is biased towards comfort food since I wrote it while hungry. Probably should make
                something
                from this list. Food is more than just fuel—it’s comfort, culture, and pure joy on a plate. This list
                highlights my current top 5
                favorite foods, chosen not just for taste but for the memories and satisfaction they bring. Whether it's
                the
                bold, smoky
                flavor of tacos de asada or the creamy indulgence of cheesecake, each dish on this list earned its spot
                for
                a reason.
                Admittedly, I was pretty hungry while writing this, so comfort foods definitely won out. From savory
                Mexican
                classics
                like pozole to universally loved staples like pizza and waffles, these are the meals I crave the most
                right
                now. If
                you're looking for food that hits the spot every time, you're in the right place.</p>

                <figcaption>Bowl of red pozole</figcaption>
                <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican soup or stew made with hominy (nixtamalized corn) and typically
                    features pork
                    or chicken
                    as the main protein. It's simmered for hours with garlic, onions, and spices like oregano and cumin,
                    creating a rich,
                    flavorful broth. Pozole comes in three main varieties—rojo (red), verde (green), and blanco
                    (white)—depending on the
                    added chilies and herbs. It's commonly served with fresh toppings like shredded lettuce or cabbage,
                    radishes, lime,
                    oregano, and tostadas, making it both hearty and refreshing. Often enjoyed during celebrations and
                    holidays,
                    pozole is a
                    beloved staple of Mexican cuisine.</p>

                <figcaption>A pair of tacos de asada</figcaption>
                <p>Tacos de asada are a classic and beloved Mexican street food made with grilled, marinated
                    beef—usually skirt
                    or flank
                    steak—served on warm corn tortillas. The meat is typically seasoned with ingredients like lime
                    juice,
                    garlic, and spices
                    before being seared to perfection for a smoky, savory flavor. They're often topped simply with
                    chopped
                    onions, fresh
                    cilantro, salsa, and a squeeze of lime. Easy to eat and packed with bold flavor, tacos de asada are
                    a staple
                    at taco
                    stands, backyard cookouts, and Mexican food festivals alike.</p>

                <p>Waffles are a popular breakfast dish made from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and butter, cooked
                    between two
                    hot plates
                    to create a crisp, grid-like texture. Golden and crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the
                    inside,
                    waffles are
                    endlessly versatile. They can be topped with butter, syrup, fruit, whipped cream, or even fried
                    chicken for
                    a savory
                    twist. Originating in Europe, waffles have become a worldwide favorite thanks to their satisfying
                    texture
                    and
                    customizable flavor combinations.</p>

                <figcaption>Pizza mmmmmmmmmm</figcaption>
                <p>Pizza is a globally loved dish that originated in Italy, traditionally made with a thin, round crust
                    topped
                    with tomato
                    sauce, cheese, and various toppings like pepperoni, vegetables, or olives. Baked in an oven until
                    the cheese
                    melts and
                    the crust turns golden, pizza is known for its perfect balance of crispy, chewy, and gooey textures.
                    Styles
                    vary
                    widely—from classic Neapolitan to deep-dish Chicago and thin-crust New York. Whether enjoyed plain
                    or piled
                    high with
                    toppings, pizza's universal appeal lies in its bold flavors, shareable nature, and endless
                    customizability.

                <figcaption>Should have made a cheesecake tier list</figcaption>
                <p>Cheesecake is a rich, creamy dessert made primarily from cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, set on a
                    graham
                    cracker crust.
                    The filling is smooth and velvety, often flavored with vanilla, lemon, or other variations.
                    Cheesecake can
                    be baked or
                    chilled, and is sometimes topped with fruit, chocolate, or caramel for extra sweetness and texture.
                    It has a
                    dense yet
                    light texture that melts in your mouth, making it a favorite for special occasions and celebrations.
                    With
                    endless flavor
                    variations, from classic New York-style to fruity or chocolate versions, cheesecake offers a
                    decadent treat
                    for any
                    dessert lover.
