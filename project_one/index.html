    <p>
        Two of my current hobbies or passions are playing video games and cooking for myself or the family when I do
        get
        a chance. Both passions developed from a very young age, cooking from watching my mother in the kitchen and
        helping whenever I was allowed too and gaming which came from when they first bought me the n64. By
        navigating
        to the top of the page you can find out more about my passions like what are my favorite dishes or what im
        currently playing.
