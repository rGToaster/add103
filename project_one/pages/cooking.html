    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>My love for cooking comes from just finding it relaxing. Although I find it relaxing when I'm cooking alone. When
        I have
        help it is appreciated but It drives me crazy when the help does not do it the way I like it. Also I just feel
        pride in
        what I make and get that sense of accomplishment when it all comes together and tastes good to me. Well that's
        enough
        for me, let's talk about what I like to eat/make.
    </p>
    <h3>Tacos de asada</h3>
    <p>
        Tacos de asada are the classic choice for most when making them or ordering from your local Mexican restaurant.
        Although
        simple when it comes to preparing and what it looks like you have to think of taco as a canvasâ€¦ let me explain.
        Although
        all you need for a taco is just the meat and the tortilla there is so much more you can add to it and that's
        where you
        can be unique and not get bored. Toppings that range from the simple cilantro and onions to fried potatoes and
        prickly
        pear cactus. Your imagination is the limit.

    <h3>Pozole</h3>
    <p>
        Pozole, the national stew of mexico. I say national but in reality every region in Mexico has its own twist on
        the stew.
        To keep it brief we can categorize the pozole into three categories: pozole rojo (red), pozole verde (green) and
        pozole
        blanco (plain). Typically each one has its die hard fans that believe the other two are inferior to their
        favorites. The
        color comes from what chilies and tomatoes you used for the base of the sauce. For green you use serranos or
        jalapenos
        and green tomatillos(green tomatoes). While Red pozole gets its color from tomatoes and using guajillo, piquin
        or
        hancho. Last but not the least pozole blanco which forgoes the tomatoes and chillies typically the choice for
        children
        who can be picky as it is not spicy and simple. Also, just like tacos the toppings are how you make it unique to
        you like:
