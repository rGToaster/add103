    <h1>Anthony's Favorite Things</h1>
    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p> Currently have 1 cat that loves nothing more than food and sleeping. She is a big calico cat that knows how to
        give paw for treats but only her left paw. I assume she is just a lefty or that she justs too old at this point
        to learn with her right paw.</p>

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Mostly like to pay competitive games like League of legends, Rocket league, and occasionally CSGO2. Rarely find
        single players games fun personally but i did pick up Cyberpunk 2077 and have been enjoying it for the past 1
        month or so. Also party games online likr mario party or pummel party with my friends is alot of fun.</p>
    <h3>What I use</h3>
    <p>I do 99% of my gaming on my windows pc that i built back in 2020. which worked out great for the covid 19 era
        when everything went online. Before that i had been only console user and was part of team xbox when it came
        down to the console wars of the 2010s.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>Just like cooking in general it seems to relax me while im doing it. Although I do not enjoy anybody else in the
        kitchen while im in there. I especially despite people helping me, I do appreciate the help but I want them to
        help as I imagine my head them helping me. They never do help like i imagine them doing it so i rather have no
        help. lol</p>
    <h3>Favorite food too cook</h3>
    <p>I love cooking mexican food because my mother taught from a young age to be able too cook for myself. which meant
        i learned how to cook mexican food. If it isnt mexican food its chinese food in close second typically make
        stirfries which are quick and easy and store well for food prep for me.</p>

        take the class to figure out if i like it. </p>
