            <p>Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee
                Set two decades after To Kill a Mockingbird, this novel follows Jean Louise “Scout” Finch as she
                returns to her hometown
                of Maycomb, Alabama. Now an adult, she grapples with personal beliefs and disillusionment as she
                discovers troubling
                truths about her father, Atticus Finch. The story explores themes of identity, race, and moral
                complexity during the
                early Civil Rights era. Though controversial for its portrayal of beloved characters, Go Set a
                Watchman offers a
                thought-provoking look at growing up and reconciling ideals with reality.

        <div class="book">
            <p>Dune by Frank Herbert
                Set in a distant future where noble houses vie for control of planets, Dune follows Paul Atreides, a
                young heir whose
                family is betrayed after taking stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis. The planet is the only
                source of “melange,” a
                powerful spice critical to space travel. As Paul navigates political intrigue, prophecy, and
                rebellion, he becomes
                entwined with the native Fremen and his destiny as a potential messiah. Blending science fiction
                with ecology, religion,
                and power dynamics, Dune is a rich, epic tale of survival and transformation in a harsh, unforgiving
                world.

            <p>The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
                Set in the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious
                millionaire known for his
                lavish parties and undying love for Daisy Buchanan. Narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby’s neighbor and
                Daisy’s cousin, the
                novel explores themes of wealth, illusion, love, and the American Dream. As Gatsby tries to
                recapture a lost past, the
                glittering facade of high society begins to crack, revealing emptiness beneath. With lyrical prose
                and sharp social
                commentary, Fitzgerald paints a haunting portrait of ambition and longing in Jazz Age America.

        <h2>Honorable Mention</h2>
        <div class="book">
            <p>Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
                In a dystopian future where books are banned and “firemen” burn them, Guy Montag begins to question the
                society he once
                served. As a fireman, his job is to destroy knowledge, but encounters with a curious young woman and a
                group
                of secret
                readers ignite a transformation in him. Fahrenheit 451 explores themes of censorship, conformity, and
                the
                power of
                knowledge in a world numbed by mass media and shallow entertainment. Bradbury’s classic is a chilling
                warning about
                losing critical thought and the consequences of a controlled, unthinking society.</p>

        <h3>In summary</h3>
        <p>These books have stuck with me over the years for their bold ideas, unforgettable characters, and the way
            they
            challenged me to think differently. Whether it’s the dark fantasy of Berserk, the political depth of Dune,
            or the
            emotional resonance of The Great Gatsby, each one brought something unique to the table. This list reflects
            the
            stories that left the biggest impact on me during a time when reading was a daily escape.</p>
