        <h1>Top 5 films</h1>
        <p> My top 5 films offer a diverse range of storytelling, from gripping dramas to thought-provoking sci-fi. Each
            one leaves
            a lasting impression with unique themes, unforgettable characters, and powerful visuals. Whether it’s
            exploring the
            complexities of love in Her, the brutal pursuit of perfection in Whiplash, or the brutal yet redemptive
            journey in
            Django Unchained, these films showcase the power of cinema to evoke deep emotions and spark meaningful
            reflection.</p>

            <p>Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan, set in a future where Earth is
                facing
                environmental collapse. A group of astronauts, led by Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), travels through a
                wormhole in search
                of a new habitable planet. Along the way, they encounter mind-bending concepts like time dilation, black
                holes, and the
                survival of humanity. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the limits of human knowledge,
                with a
                mix of
                scientific theory and emotional storytelling. It’s both visually stunning and intellectually complex,
                with a
                powerful,

                impress
                Fletcher, the film explores the cost of artistic greatness, the fine line between motivation and abuse,
                and
                the
                psychological toll of relentless ambition. Whiplash is gripping, intense, and features outstanding
                performances,
