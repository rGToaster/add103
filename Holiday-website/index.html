    <h1>Christmas</h1>
    <h2>Trees</h2>
    <p>
        When picking a tree what i feel is the most important question is, do i buy a fake tree or get a real one. Lets
        figure out some advantages too both.
    </p>

    <h3>Artificial Trees vs Real Trees</h3>
    <p>
        For me personally the artificial tree is the way to go. It has many advantages over its real deal like ; not
        needed to be watered, no loose needles needed to be swept up , and also some come with lights already
        installed.
        While the artificial tree seems like the better choice nothing can beat the joy of having a real tree. From
        going with the family to get the tree, the decorating with family and putting the star at the top.

    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>
        When making gift purchases it can be nerve raking if you do not get it right. There is a better way to handle it

    <h3>Surprise gifts or make a list and share with family</h3>
    <p>
        When buying gifts for family members it can be hard. You may feel that you may disappoint them if you do not get
        it right. On the other hand when you do get it right it feels amazing. Now a days though i see a lot more family
        or extended family like friends using apps that just shares what you want to take the guess work out of it. If
        your family prefers just buy what you feel the other person may like. I like to throw in the receipt just in
        case and not feel bad if i got it wrong.

    <h2>Traditions</h2>
    <p>
        If you have your own thats great too hear and this next paragraph might not be for you. If you are looking too
        start one for yourself, family, or with friends. I got few suggestions that may intrigue you or a starting point
        where you can make your own.

    <h3>Some ideas</h3>
    <p>
        Watch a christmas movie with the family christmas eve night. I personally love the movie <i>elf starring Will
            Ferrell</i>. Another tradition would be building ginger bread houses and have a prize for the best looking
        one. volunteer at a local soup kitchen or any local place that supports the needy during the holidays. whatever
        you do decide on doing just make sure you are having a good time with people you hold dearest in this world.
